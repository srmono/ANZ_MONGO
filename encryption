Encryption

Generate or Obtain Encryption Keys :

-- For Data at Rest Encryption
For Data at Rest Encryption: MongoDB uses the WiredTiger storage engine, which supports encryption at rest. To enable it, you'll need an encryption key. You can generate a key using a tool like OpenSSL:

openssl rand -base64 96 > mongodb-keyfile
chmod 600 mongodb-keyfile


Configure MongoDB for Encryption
Edit the MongoDB configuration file (typically mongod.conf)

storage:
  encryption:
    keyFile: /path/to/mongodb-keyfile




-- For TLS/SSL Encryption: 
If you want to enable encryption for data transmitted between clients and the MongoDB server, you'll need a TLS/SSL certificate and key. You can either generate self-signed certificates or obtain them from a trusted certificate authority.



Edit the MongoDB configuration file and configure TLS/SSL settings


net:
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
  port: 27017
  ssl:
    mode: requireSSL
    PEMKeyFile: /path/to/ssl/key.pem
    PEMKeyPassword: your_password
    CAFile: /path/to/ssl/ca.pem


-- Restart service/server

sudo service mongod restart


-- Test the encryption
mongo --ssl --host localhost --port 27017 --username your_username --password your_password --authenticationDatabase admin
